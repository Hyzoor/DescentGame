//TODO
    - Finish turn functionality: selection attack
    - Implement dead methods, check and do something when killing an entity


//Changes made

I moved the calculateDamage function from the entity class to the turn class,
so turn class manages the whole turn in a battle: attack selection, calculateDamage, and then the defender takes the damage.

Added a small test on main class.
